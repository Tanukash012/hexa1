        <p>Since Rajasthan is mostly an arid state, wheat and millets form the staple diet instead of rice (which are common in rest of India).

            Various breads are prepared from wheat like tawa roti, Angarki/Tandoori roti, Kinwani roti (naturally fermented flour roti) etc. Khoba Roti is a special roti from Rajasthan which is prepared by pinching the dough to make a beautiful pattern of indentations on roti.[17] It is very common to prepare large sized rotis called Rotlas/Bhakri using flour of millets like Bajra (Pearl millet), Makai (Maize), Jowar etc.
            
            Gram flour is usually mixed with wheat flour to prepare missi atta which is then used to prepare Missi Roti.
