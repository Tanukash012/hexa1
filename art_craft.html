    <div class="container art_craft">
        <p>India is a country with a rich and diverse cultural heritage, and it is home to a wide range of artifacts
            that reflect its history, art, and craftsmanship. Our nation, India has managed to bring to bring back
            around 212 artefacts back from foreign nations since 1975, the overwhelming majority of these returns
            effected by the Narendra Modi Government, which is prioritizing the repatriation of treasures obtained
            illegally from India. Thousands of objects taken from India as war trophies, excavated loot, souvenirs and
            specimens for scientific study. Much of the heritage has escaped our borders, the Kohinoor, it still remains
            in the possession of Queen of England, it is only one sparkling example. Here are some notable artifacts and
            categories of artifacts from India:</p>

                <p> The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's oldest urban civilizations, left behind numerous
                    artifacts, including pottery, seals, jewelry, and sculptures. The seals, in particular, are famous
                    for their intricate designs and writing systems that have not yet been fully deciphered.</p>

                <p>The term Harappan is sometimes applied to the Indus civilisation after its type site Harappa, the
                    first to be excavated early in the 20th century in what was then the Punjab province of British
                    India and is now Punjab, Pakistan.The discovery of Harappa and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro was the
                    culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the
                    British Raj in 1861.There were earlier and later cultures called Early Harappan and Late Harappan in
                    the same area. The early Harappan cultures were populated from Neolithic cultures, the earliest and
                    best-known of which is Mehrgarh, in Balochistan, Pakistan.[Harappan civilisation is sometimes called
                    Mature Harappan to distinguish it from the earlier cultures.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center sub_heading">EAL MOHENJO DARO</h3>
            <div class="col-6">
                <p>Mohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE.It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus
                    Valley Civilisation, also known as the Harappan Civilization,which developed around 3,000 BCE from
                    the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now
                    Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and
                    northwards to an outpost in Bactria, with major urban centers at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal,
                    Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. <br><br>
                    <b>Architecture :</b>Mohenjo-daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid
                    plan.Most were built of fired and mortared brick; some incorporated sun-dried mud-brick and wooden
                    superstructures. The covered area of Mohenjo-daro is estimated at 300 hectares.The Oxford Handbook
                    of Cities in World History offers a "weak" estimate of a peak population of around 40,000.
                    The sheer size of the city, and its provision of public buildings and facilities, suggests a high
                    level of social organization.The city is divided into two parts, the so-called Citadel and the Lower
                    City. The Citadel : a mud-brick mound around 12 metres (39 ft) high : is known to have supported
                    public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large
                    assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households
                    or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Waste water was channeled to
                    covered drains that lined the major streets.

                <p>Fifty-five Sanskrit manuscripts are in the collection of the 19th-century German Indologist Albrecht
                    Weber, which the Library of Congress acquired in 1904. Some of these are Weber handwritten copies of
                    manuscripts housed in other institutions and collections, and some are copies produced by other
                    scholars, mostly in the late 19th century. Thirteen are in Devanagari script, while the rest are a
                    mix of Devanagari and romanized transliteration. Many also contain Weber handwritten marginalia,
                    indicating his notes on variations in different manuscripts of the same work. Here is some
                    information about Sanskrit manuscripts:<br><br>
                    <b>Script and Writing Material: </b>Sanskrit manuscripts were traditionally written on various
                    materials, including palm leaves, birch bark, paper, and, in later periods, cloth and metal. The
                    writing was typically done with a stylus or a special kind of pen, and the manuscripts were often
                    preserved by binding the leaves together into bundles.<br><br>
                    <b>Conservation and Preservation:</b>Many Sanskrit manuscripts are ancient and delicate, requiring
                    careful conservation efforts. Preservation involves digitization, restoration, and maintaining
                    proper environmental conditions to prevent deterioration.

            <div class="col-6">
                <p>Indian miniature paintings are known for their intricate details and vibrant colors. These paintings
                    often depict scenes from mythology, royal courts, and daily life. The Mughal, Rajput, and Pahari
                    schools of miniature painting are among the most famous. Miniature paintings are fine-looking,
                    handcrafted works of art. These paintings are bright and colourful, but they are small. The
                    elaborate and delicate brushwork that gives these paintings their individual identity is their best
                    feature. Colors for miniatures are made by hand. Pure gold, silver, minerals, plants, valuable
                    stones, indigo, and conch shells are the most common sources. Here are some key aspects of Indian
                    miniature painting: <br><br>
                    <b>Historical Origins:</b>Indian miniature painting has a long history dating back to ancient times,
                    with early examples found in the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Maharashtra, which date from the 5th to
                    7th centuries CE. However, it reached its zenith during the Mughal Empire in the 16th to 18th
                    centuries and continued to flourish in various regional schools.<br><br>
                    <b>Regional Styles:</b>Indian miniature painting has evolved into several distinct regional styles,
                    each with its unique characteristics and influences. Some of the prominent schools of Indian
                    miniature painting include:
                <ul>
                    <li> Mughal School</li>
                    <li> Rajput School</li>
                    <li>Pala School</li>

                <p> Located in Karnataka, the Mysore Palace is an architectural marvel known for its Indo-Saracenic
                    style. The palace is adorned with exquisite artworks, including intricate ceilings, stained glass,
                    and paintings. The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally,
                    "citadel"). Swapna built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set
                    ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire,
                    while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed
                    between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the
                    New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal,
                    with more than six million annual visitors.Here are some key details about the Mysore
                    Palace:<br><br>
                    <b>History:</b>The original Mysore Palace was built in the 14th century by the Wadiyar dynasty, the
                    ruling family of Mysore. However, the current palace, which is a blend of Hindu, Islamic, Gothic,
                    and Rajput architectural styles, was constructed in the late 19th century.<br><br>
                    <b>Architectural Style: </b>The Mysore Palace is an outstanding example of Indo-Saracenic
                    architecture, which incorporates elements from multiple architectural traditions. It features
                    intricate arches, domes, turrets, and a beautiful marble facade, giving it a majestic appearance.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Design:</b>The palace is a three-story structure with a central courtyard. It is adorned with
                    ornate archways, colorful stained glass windows, and intricate frescoes. The interior is equally
                    opulent, with lavish rooms, chandeliers, and gilded columns.

            <div class="col-6">
                <p>The Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Rajasthan, is a significant Sufi shrine. It houses a
                    collection of artifacts, including chandeliers, Islamic calligraphy, and the tomb of the revered
                    saint.<br><br>
                    <b>Architecture :</b>The white marble dome of Chishti's shrine, as seen today, was built in 1532.
                    This date is inscribed in golden letters on the Northern wall of the dargah. It is an example of
                    Indo-Islamic architecture and the dome features a lotus and a crown of gold, donated by Rampur's
                    Nawab Haider Ali Khan.It is located in the Ihaata Noorani of the complex.Materials used to build it
                    include marble, brick and sandstone. The dargah has a royal darbar, Mehfil Khana, that was
                    constructed in 1888. It is a square structure and has a patterned ceiling.Jahanara Begum donated the
                    dargah's left facet (Begumi Dalaan),the railing around the dargah and also constructed a small
                    platform, the Begumi Chabutra. The sanctum of the dargah has two doors. The canopy made of
                    mother-of-pearl and silver was commissioned by Jahangir and is visible from the cenotaph's four
                    silver posts.The ceiling is etched with gold and in 1888, the walls were gilded.

                <p>The region of Bengal is known for its terracotta artifacts, including sculptures and pottery. These
                    artifacts often depict mythological themes and are distinctive for their reddish-brown
                    color.Throughout the ancient world, one of the most common uses of terra-cotta was for
                    building-brick, roof tiles, and sarcophagi, the last often decorated with paintings. Small
                    terra-cotta figures from the Early Bronze Age, as early as 3000 BCE, have been found in Greece, and
                    larger objects dating from the 7th century BCE have also been found. Greek artists carried the craft
                    to Etruria, whence both Etruscan and Greek sculptors moved to work in Rome. Most Greek terra-cotta
                    statuary, more common than once thought, was used to decorate temples. The modeled Etruscan statues,
                    at times very Greek in style but often with a gayer or fiercer flavour, were admired widely in
                    antiquity. </p>
